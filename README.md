# KyTunes

A music player for files on your computer. Another computer or a phone runs the same app and streams songs from the one machine that holds the library. Nothing is copied until you tap **Keep** on a song.

**[Install KyTunes](https://kylemath.github.io/KyTunes)** — the same player, hosted on GitHub Pages. Open that link and install it from the browser. It starts with the built-in tracks. Add a server from the library menu when you want one.

## Play a folder on this computer

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the address Vite prints and choose **Select music folder**. This uses the file picker in desktop Chrome. On macOS, pointing it at `~/Music` skips GarageBand, Logic, Audio Music Apps, and MainStage. Those are app folders, and GarageBand is often blocked by the system. Other unreadable folders are skipped instead of stopping the scan.

`npm run launch`, and the KyTunes Mac app from `npm run create-app`, start the player only. It opens as a slave: join a library, or choose Server on the welcome screen to host on this computer. `npm run library` and `npm run share` still work from a terminal.

## Library server

On the computer that has the music:

```bash
npm run library -- --dir ~/Music --password 'choose-a-password'
```

The password is stored only as a hash in `library.config.json`, which is not committed. The process listens on port 8787 and prints where it can be reached. Use that printed address from other devices. Do not put a home address in this repo.

The server sends the song list and the audio. Seeking requests a slice of the file. **Keep** is what saves a whole song on the device you are using.

## Another computer

Clone this project, run `npm install` and `npm run dev`, then choose **Connect to library server**. Enter the address printed by the library machine, for example `http://<library-computer>:8787`, and the password. That computer plays from its own copy of the app. Only the catalog and the audio cross the network.

## Phone

There is no app-store install. Open the player in the phone browser, then use **Add to Home Screen**.

On the same Wi-Fi, with this project running:

- `npm run dev` prints an address the phone can open. The interface loads from the dev server, and the songs come from the library server.
- `npm run build` once, then the library server on port 8787 can serve the player page as well as the audio. The phone can open that address without the dev server.

A home-screen install that behaves as its own app needs HTTPS. Away from home, install Tailscale on the library machine and the phone, run `tailscale serve 8787`, open that `https://` address, and add it to the home screen. A plain `http://` address on your network still plays in the browser.

Android Chrome cannot browse an arbitrary music folder. The phone streams, and **Keep** stores the songs you want on the device.

## Installed from GitHub Pages

[https://kylemath.github.io/KyTunes](https://kylemath.github.io/KyTunes) is this app. Chrome and Edge show an install icon. On a phone, use **Add to Home Screen**. The installed window is the player: library 0 is the five public-domain recordings in `public/demo/` (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, and Vivaldi, from Musopen, the European Archive, and the Modena Chamber Orchestra), plus any folder you pick and any song you have already played from a server.

The page is HTTPS. It can connect to an `https://` library, such as Tailscale Serve. A home `http://` address is blocked by the browser. On your own network, run the app locally and connect, as above.

Pages deploys with GitHub Actions (`npm run build:pages`) when `main` is pushed. That build is the installable app. The library server build stays at `/` and serves the same player with the music.
